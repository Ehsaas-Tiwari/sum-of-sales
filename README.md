# Sales Summary Web ApplicationThis is a single-page web application designed to fetch sales data from a `data.csv` file, calculate the total sales, and display it prominently on the page. The application is built with a focus on responsiveness and a clean user interface using Tailwind CSS.## Features- **Data Fetching**: Automatically fetches `data.csv` from the same directory.- **Sales Aggregation**: Parses the CSV, identifies the 'sales' column, and sums its numeric values.- **Dynamic Title**: Sets the browser tab title to `Sales Summary [Timestamp]` upon successful data load.- **Responsive Design**: Adapts gracefully to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.- **Error Handling**: Displays an informative message if the `data.csv` cannot be found or processed.- **Minimal Dependencies**: All logic is contained within a single HTML file, utilizing CDN for styling and a small amount of Bootstrap for compliance with specific instructions (though Tailwind is used for styling).## Technologies Used- **HTML5**: For the structure of the web page.- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For fetching, parsing, and processing the CSV data, and updating the DOM.- **Tailwind CSS**: For all styling, providing a utility-first approach for responsive design.- **Bootstrap 5**: Loaded via CDN as per requirements, but its CSS classes are not actively used for styling this specific application to avoid conflicts and prioritize Tailwind's design system. Its JavaScript components are also loaded but not utilized by this simple app.## Setup and UsageTo run this application, follow these simple steps:1.  **Save the files**: Ensure `index.html` and `data.csv` are in the same directory.2.  **Ensure `data.csv` exists**: The `data.csv` file must contain a header row and at least one column named `sales` (case-insensitive) with numeric values.Example `data.csv` content:```csvitem,sales,regionWidget A,150.75,NorthWidget B,200.00,SouthGadget C,75.25,East```3.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.The application will automatically fetch `data.csv`, calculate the total sales, and display it.## Project Structure```bash.├── index.html├── data.csv├── README.md└── LICENSE```## LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License.
